# Example Project

![Example project](/img/example/example.png)

There is an example project created for people to refer to when learning how to use the SDK, as well as for various examples about how to do things.

The example project is in the form of a Unity 2021.3 project, so you will need Unity 2021.3 in order to open it.

[You can find the example project here, on GitHub](https://github.com/figglewatts/LSDR-Additional-Dreams).
